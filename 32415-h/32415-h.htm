<br style="line-height: 90%" /><b>HE</b> great encouragement which has
been given by the public to the previous
editions of this little work, satisfactorily
proves that, notwithstanding the extension
of serious education to all but the very
earliest periods of life, there still exists
an undying love for the popular remnants of
the ancient Scandinavian nursery literature.
The infants and children of the nineteenth
century have not, then, deserted the rhymes
chanted so many ages since by the mothers of
the North. This is a "great nursery fact"&mdash;a
proof that there is contained in some of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiv" id="pageiv"></a>[page iv]</span>
these traditional nonsense-rhymes a meaning
and a romance, possibly intelligible only to
very young minds, that exercise an influence
on the fancy of children. It is obvious there
must exist something of this kind; for no
modern compositions are found to supply
altogether the place of the ancient <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'doggrel'">doggerel</ins>.</p>

<p>The nursery rhyme is the novel and light
reading of the infant scholar. It occupies,
with respect to the A B C, the position of a
romance which relieves the mind from the
cares of a riper age. The absurdity and frivolity
of a rhyme may naturally be its chief
attractions to the very young; and there will
be something lost from the imagination of
that child, whose parents insist so much on
matters of fact, that the "cow" must be
made, in compliance with the rules of their
educational code, to jump "<i>under</i>" instead
of "<i>over</i> the moon;" while of course the
little dog must be considered as "barking,"
not "laughing" at the circumstance.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagev" id="pagev"></a>[page v]</span>

<p>These, or any such objections,&mdash;for it
seems there are others of about equal weight,&mdash;are,
it appears to me, more silly than the
worst nursery rhyme the little readers will
meet with in the following pages. I am
quite willing to leave the question to their
decision, feeling assured the catering for
them has not been in vain, and that these
cullings from the high-ways and bye-ways&mdash;they
have been collected from nearly every
county in England&mdash;will be to them real
flowers, soothing the misery of many an
hour of infantine adversity.</p>

<p>He called for his pipe,</p>

<div class="figcenter1">
<p class="note1">
[The traditional Nursery Rhymes of England commence with a legendary
satire on King Cole, who reigned in Britain, as the old chroniclers inform
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[page 2]</span>
us, in the third century after Christ. According to Robert of Gloucester, he
was the father of St. Helena, and if so, Butler must be wrong in ascribing
an obscure origin to the celebrated mother of Constantine. King Cole was
a brave and popular man in his day, and ascended the throne of Britain on
the death of Asclepiod, amidst the acclamations of the people, or, as Robert
of Gloucester expresses himself, the "fole was tho of this lond y-paid wel
y-nou." At Colchester there is a large earthwork, supposed to have been
a Roman amphitheatre, which goes popularly by the name of "King Cole's
kitchen." According to Jeffrey of Monmouth, King Cole's daughter was
well skilled in music, but we unfortunately have no evidence to show that
her father was attached to that science, further than what is contained in
the foregoing lines, which are of doubtful antiquity. The following version
of the song is of the seventeenth century, the one given above being probably
a modernization:&mdash;</p>

<p>Good King Cole,</p>

<p>And twice fiddle fiddle,</p>
<p>For 'twas my lady's birth-day;</p>

the popular epigram of "Jack and Jill." I do not know the period of the
battle to which it appears to allude, but Tarlton died in the year 1588, so
that the rhyme must be earlier.]

<h4>THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.</h4>

<p class="indboth">Once upon a time there was an old sow
with three little pigs, and as she had not
enough to keep them, she sent them out to
seek their fortune. The first that went off
met a man with a bundle of straw, and said
to him, "Please, man, give me that straw
to build me a house;" which the man did,
and the little pig built a house with it.
Presently came along a wolf, and knocked
at the door, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indboth">"Little pig, little pig, let me come in."</p>

<p class="indboth">To which the pig answered,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indboth">"No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'shin'">chin</ins>."</p>

<p class="indboth">The wolf then answered to that,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indboth">"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll
blow your house in."</p>

<p class="indboth">So he huffed, and he puffed, and he blew
his house in, and eat up the little pig.</p>

<p class="indboth">The second little pig met a man with a
bundle of furze, and said, "Please, man,
give me that furze to build a house;" which
the man did, and the pig built his house.
Then along came the wolf, and said,&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[page 38]</span>

<p class="indboth">"Little pig, little pig, let me come in."</p>

<p class="indboth">"No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin
chin."</p>

<p class="indboth">"Then I'll puff, and I'll huff, and I'll
blow your house in."</p>

<p class="indboth">So he huffed, and he puffed, and he
puffed, and he huffed, and at last he blew
the house down, and he eat up the little
pig.</p>

<p class="indboth">The third little pig met a man with a
load of bricks, and said, "Please, man, give
me those bricks to build a house with;" so
the man gave him the bricks, and he built
his house with them. So the wolf came, as
he did to the other little pigs, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indboth">"Little pig, little pig, let me come in."</p>

<p class="indboth">"No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin
chin."</p>

<p class="indboth">"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll
blow your house in."</p>

<p class="indboth">Well, he huffed, and he puffed, and he
huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed,
and he huffed; but he could <i>not</i> get the
house down. When he found that he
could not, with all his huffing and puffing,
blow the house down, he said, "Little pig,
I know where there is a nice field of
turnips." "Where?" said the little pig.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[page 39]</span>
"Oh, in Mr. Smith's Home-field, and if you
will be ready to-morrow morning I will call
for you, and we will go together, and get
some for dinner." "Very well," said the
little pig, "I will be ready. What time do
you mean to go?" "Oh, at six o'clock."
Well, the little pig got up at five, and got
the turnips before the wolf came&mdash;(which
he did about six)&mdash;and who said, "Little
pig, are you ready?" The little pig said,
"Ready! I have been, and come back again,
and got a nice pot-full for dinner." The
wolf felt very angry at this, but thought
that he would be <i>up to</i> the little pig somehow
or other, so he said, "Little pig, I know
where there is a nice apple-tree." "Where?"
said the pig. "Down at Merry-garden,"
replied the wolf, "and if you will not
deceive me I will come for you, at five
o'clock to-morrow, and we will go together
and get some apples." Well, the little pig
bustled up the next morning at four o'clock,
and went off for the apples, hoping to get
back before the wolf came; but he had
further to go, and had to climb the tree, so
that just as he was coming down from it,
he saw the wolf coming, which, as you may
suppose, frightened him very much. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[page 40]</span>
the wolf came up he said, "Little pig,
what! are you here before me? Are they
nice apples?" "Yes, very," said the little
pig. "I will throw you down one;" and
he threw it so far, that, while the wolf was
gone to pick it up, the little pig jumped
down and ran home. The next day the
wolf came again, and said to the little pig,
"Little pig, there is a fair at Shanklin this
afternoon, will you go?" "Oh yes," said
the pig, "I will go; what time shall you be
ready?" "At three," said the wolf. So
the little pig went off before the time as
usual, and got to the fair, and bought a
butter-churn, which he was going home
with, when he saw the wolf coming. Then
he could not tell what to do. So he got
into the churn to hide, and by so doing
turned it round, and it rolled down the
hill with the pig in it, which frightened
the wolf so much, that he ran home without
going to the fair. He went to the little
pig's house, and told him how frightened he
had been by a great round thing which
came down the hill past him. Then the
little pig said, "Hah, I frightened you then.
I had been to the fair and bought a butter-churn,
and when I saw you, I got into it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[page 41]</span>
and rolled down the hill." Then the wolf
was very angry indeed, and declared he
<i>would</i> eat up the little pig, and that he
would get down the chimney after him.
When the little pig saw what he was about,
he hung on the pot full of water, and made
up a blazing fire, and, just as the wolf was
coming down, took off the cover, and in fell
the wolf; so the little pig put on the cover
again in an instant, boiled him up, and eat
him for supper, and lived happy ever afterwards.</p>

Julius Pollux, and also by Eustathius, in his commentary upon Homer.
Brand quotes a curious passage from Minucius Felix; but all antiquaries
seem to have overlooked the very curious notice in Higgins' adaptation of
Junius's 'Nomenclator,' 8vo, London, 1585, p. 299, where it is called "a
duck and a drake, and a halfe-penie cake." Thus it is probable that lines
like the following were employed in this game as early as 1585; and it may
be that the last line has recently furnished a hint to Mathews in his
amusing song in 'Patter <i>v</i>. Clatter.']</p>

retired into solitude, to avoid infection; built on a small streamlet, tributary
to the Almond, in a sequestered corner called <i>Burn-brae</i>, a bower, and lived

communicated to them the fatal contagion, of which they soon after died."]

  </div>  </div>

<div class="figcenter1">
<p class="note2">
The following is the interpretation:</p>

<p class="note2">1. The kid, which was one of the pure animals, denotes the Hebrews.</p>

<p class="note2">The father, by whom it was purchased, is Jehovah, who represents himself
as sustaining this relation to the Hebrew nation. The two pieces of
money signify Moses and Aaron, through whose mediation the Hebrews
were brought out of Egypt.</p>

<p class="note2">2. The cat denotes the Assyrians, by whom the ten tribes were carried
into captivity.</p>

<p class="note2">3. The dog is symbolical of the Babylonians.</p>

<p class="note2">4. The staff signifies the Persians.</p>

<p class="note2">5. The fire indicates the Grecian empire under Alexander the Great.</p>

<p class="note2">6. The water betokens the Roman, or the fourth of the great monarchies
to whose dominions the Jews were subjected.</p>

<p class="note2">7. The ox is a symbol of the Saracens, who subdued Palestine, and brought
it under the caliphate.</p>

<p class="note2">8. The butcher that killed the ox denotes the crusaders, by whom the
Holy Land was wrested out of the hands of the Saracens.</p>

<p class="note2">9. The angel of death signifies the Turkish power, by which the land of
Palestine was taken from the Franks, and to which it is still subject.</p>

<p class="note2">10. The commencement of the tenth stanza is designed to show that God
will take signal vengeance on the Turks, immediately after whose overthrow
the Jews are to be restored to their own land, and live under the government
of their long-expected Messiah.

<p class="indboth">"<span class="sc"><b>An</b></span> old woman was sweeping her house,
and she found a little crooked sixpence.
'What,' said she, 'shall I do with this little
sixpence? I will go to market, and buy a
little pig.' As she was coming home, she
came to a stile: the piggy would not go
over the stile.</p>

<p class="indboth">"She went a little further, and she met
a dog. So she said to the dog, 'Dog! bite
pig; piggy won't go over the stile; and I
shan't get home to-night.' But the dog
would not.</p>

<p class="indboth">"She went a little further, and she met a
stick. So she said, 'Stick! stick! beat dog;
dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get over
the stile; and I shan't get home to-night.'
But the stick would not.</p>

<p class="indboth">"She went a little further, and she met a
fire. So she said, 'Fire! fire! burn stick;
stick won't beat dog; dog won't bite pig,'
(<i>and so forth, always repeating the foregoing
words</i>.) But the fire would not.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[page 293]</span>

some water. So she said, 'Water! water!

the water would not.</p>

<p class="indboth">"She went a little further, and she met
an ox. So she said, 'Ox! ox! drink water;
water won't quench fire' &amp;c. But the ox
would not.</p>

<p class="indboth">"She went a little further, and she met a
butcher. So she said, 'Butcher! butcher!
kill ox; ox won't drink water,' &amp;c. But
the butcher would not.</p>

<p class="indboth">"She went a little further, and she met a
rope. So she said, 'Rope! rope! hang butcher;
butcher won't kill ox,' &amp;c. But the
rope would not.</p>

<p class="indboth">"She went a little further, and she met a
rat. So she said, 'Rat! rat! gnaw rope;
rope won't hang butcher,' &amp;c. But the rat
would not.</p>

<p class="indboth">"She went a little further, and she met a
cat. So she said, 'Cat! cat! kill rat; rat

her, 'If you will go to yonder cow, and fetch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[page 294]</span>
me a saucer of milk, I will kill the rat.' So
away went the old woman to the cow.</p>

<p class="indboth">"But the cow said to her, 'If you will go

<p class="indboth">"As soon as the cow had eaten the hay,
she gave the old woman the milk; and away
she went with it in a saucer to the cat.</p>

<p class="indboth">"As soon as the cat had lapped up the

began to gnaw the rope; the rope began to
hang the butcher; the butcher began to kill
the ox; the ox began to drink the water;
the water began to quench the fire; the fire
began to burn the stick; the stick began to

pig; the little pig in a fright jumped over
the stile; and so the old woman got home
that night."</p>

stream, and fetch us a bucket of water, we'll give you the hay. So away
the old woman went, but when she got to the stream, she found the bucket
was full of holes. So she covered the bottom with pebbles, and then filled
the bucket with water, and away she went back with it to the haymakers;

shed all its beautiful green leaves; now there

fell, it said, Walnut tree, why do you shed
your leaves? Oh! said the tree, Titty's

there was a little girl walking below, carrying
a jug of milk for her brothers' and sisters'

<h3>Transcriber's Note</h3>

<p>This book contains a lot of dialect, which has been retained.</p>

<p>page 2: 'fidlers' agrees with scan; retained, despite 'fiddle' in same
poem. 17th century and older spelling was not necessarily standardised, even
within the same sentence.</p>

<p>page 42: 'flee' is followed by 'Mr. Flea'. But 'flee' rhymes with 'Dee',
and has been retained.</p>

<p>page 75, and Index: "driving 's":
"The art of good driving 's a paradox quite," agrees with both scans,
and has been retained.</p>

<p>CCCLI.: The second small print explanatory note did not contain quote marks,
and they have not been added.</p>

<p>CCCLIII.: The missing opening and closing quote marks in the explanatory note
are implied by the first quote marks ("Eleven going for twelve."),
but have not been added.</p>

<p>CCCXCII.: 'did'nt' retained: "O then my poor baby did'nt cry!"</p>

<p>CCCCXXXII.: 'would'nt' retained: "The miller would'nt have her,"</p>

<p>Colons have been used extensively throughout the book, where, perhaps
a semi-colon would be used today. The colons have been retained, as
they seem to suggest a subtle nuance of meaning.</p>

<p>A few obvious punctuation errors have been repaired.
Old-fashioned, but correct, punctuation (which agrees with the scans) has been
retained.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are, however, some apparently genuine typographical or
printer's errors.</p>

<h4>Errata</h4>

<p>(Corrections are also indicated, in the text, by a dotted line underneath the correction.</p>
<p style="margin-top:-1em;">Scroll the mouse over the word and the original text will <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'apprear'">appear</ins>.)</p>

<p>page iv: 'doggrel' corrected to 'doggerel': "the place of the ancient
doggerel"</p>

<p>page 37: 'shin' corrected to 'chin': "No, no, by the hair of my chiny
chin chin."</p>

<p>page 92: 'buble' corrected to 'bubble': "Jack sing saddle oh,<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blowsey boys bubble oh,"</p>

<p>page 110: Músicks' corrected to Musicks (accent not on original book cover)
(http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/ravenscroft/deuteromelia/deut_01small.html)</p>

<p>page 158: 'here' corrected to 'hear': "And hear what time of day;"</p>

<p>page 222: 'scarely' corrected to 'scarcely': "that our endeavours are
scarcely likely to be attended with success."</p>

<p>page 317: 'sat' corrected to 'sate': "A pie sate on a pear-tree,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;259"</p>

<p>page 321: 'came' corrected to 'come': "Girls and boys, come out to play,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;305"</p>

<p>page 332: 'thay' corrected to 'they': "What do they call you?,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;255"</p>

<p>Sundry "Index" entries have been relocated for consistency.</p>
